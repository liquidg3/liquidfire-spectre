Where else would you go to find entities? What is an entity? It's simple, an entity is simply an object that represents
a record/document in a database.

### What about models?
I think you mean "what about data models?" Most modern frameworks use the term "model" to define what is truly an "entity."
A model is where you house your "business logic." It is what makes your app go. Many times a model will be working with
 an entity, but not always.
